## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans

Although the website is currently in a good place, I plan to make updates in the future â€” such as:

- Expanding content and case studies
- Further polishing and interactive elements

However, Iâ€™m currently focused more on learning by building **new projects**, rather than refining smaller details on this one.
